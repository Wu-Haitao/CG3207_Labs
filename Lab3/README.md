Lab 3 involves 2 compulsory tasks.

1. You will incorporate division (both signed and unsigned) into the MCycle unit given [HDL simulation only] (13 marks).

2. Incorporate MCycle unit into your processor so that it can execute MUL and DIV (32-bit variants of **mul** and **divu** for RISC-V) [HDL simulation as well as hardware] (7 marks).
